# Hey! :wave:

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Lewes. I'm an 18 year old Software Developer based in the United Kingdom. I'm an undergraduate student of Computer Science at the University of Southampton, and I work part-time as the Chief Technology Officer at [ManaLabs Inc](https://manalabs.io/).

Outside of my work, I am a big sci-fi fan and love a good ol' Star Trek binge.
